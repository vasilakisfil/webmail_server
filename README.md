#WebMail Server

A very simple web mail server written in ruby.

Before trying to run the server, Ruby needs to be installed on the system. An easy way to achieve that is by using the RVM - Ruby Version Manager tool found at https://rvm.io/

Once Ruby is installed, in order to run the server the following commands can be used:

```
bundle install #installs necessary libs
ruby server.rb
```
Then go to [http://localhost:5555/index](http://localhost:5555/index) and you should see the form.
